# Final project - Python for data science class
## Analysis and modeling of the parisian public transport's data

I ran this project with two other students from ENSAE - Jonas Lechat (https://github.com/jlechat) and Emma Leguay - , aiming at analyzing the data coming from the parisian public transports. Our goal is to understand and modelize the principal determrinants of suburb's frequentation. It is divided in three mains parts : in the first one, we import the data from websites and add our own data to the bases with webscrapping. The second one is dedicated to statistical analysis and data visualisation. In the last part, we try to implement two algorithms (linear regression and clustering) to delve into details and try some predictions.
